Data Science journey 
The first project is a spam detection using deep learing and Naive bayes method with @MarkSmith, @JinWang, @Suky,@Janki, @TobiasBoadway, and @Sekar

We implements four kinds of methods for this famous spam detection problem and compared the results
        1. Naive Bayes
        2. Neural Network
        3. Recurennt Neural Network (RNN)
        4. Convolutional Neural Netwrok (CNN)
        
For the pre-trained emeddding glove, we used the GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation with 300 dimension , which you can download it here https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
